# Linked List Insertions

## Problem Domain

Extend a Linked List to allow various insertion methods

### Feature Tasks

Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

- append
    - arguments: new value
    - adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list

- insert before
    - arguments: value, new value
    - adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified

- insert after
    - arguments: value, new value
    - adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified

## Approach & Efficiency

I took the approach to implement my methods with basic `for` and `while` loops to make my classes and functions accessible for humans to understand. I'd go back later, then optimize for efficiency.
