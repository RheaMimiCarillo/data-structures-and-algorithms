# Stack Queue Pseudo

## Challenge

Write a function called validate brackets that takes in different bracket characters and returns a boolean for weather the brackets are in matching pairs.

## Approach & Efficiency

I'm going to implement two Stacks in the constructor of the pseudo-queue and shuffle nodes from one Stack to the other Stack to do enqueues and dequeues. The efficiency is pretty bad.
